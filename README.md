- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Zurel (@mzurel; [https://mzurel.github.io/](https://mzurel.github.io/)). I am an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University working on foundations and mathematics of quantum information and quantum computation.
- 👀 I’m interested in foundations of and classical simulation algorithms for quantum computation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on implementations of classical simulation algorithms for quantum computation with magic states based on quasiprobability representations such as those in
